# Kafka + PySpark Project

This is a project that demonstrates how to consume data from Kafka using PySpark. The project includes an example application that reads data from a Kafka topic and performs some basic data processing using PySpark.

## Getting Started

Before running the application, you will need to install Kafka and PySpark. You can find instructions on how to install these dependencies below:

### Kafka

- Download Kafka from [the Apache Kafka website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).

- Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.

- Start the Zookeeper and Kafka server by running the following command from the extracted directory:

```
# Zookeeper server

bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```

```
# kafka server

bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

```
### PySpark

- Install PySpark using pip by running the following command:
```
pip install pyspark

```


## Running the Application

To run the example application, follow the steps below:

1- Start the Kafka server (if it's not already running) by following the instructions above.

2- Create a Kafka topic by running the following command:
```
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic st-topic

```
3- Start producing messages to the Kafka topic by running the following command:
```
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic st-topic

```
 or we can use kafka-python module to do same task.
